If you have a translation or correction, please fork the repository, clone it
locally, and then create a new branch (from master) 
for each set of related changes or for
a complete language pack. Once your branch is complete, *then* create a pull 
request to merge it into the main repository. Remember to "sign" your commits.

Pull requests to the repository will only be considered if they come from 
the maintainer for any translations in the request, or if the maintainer
adds a comment indicating they approve of any changes.

If you would like provide a translation, please send me an email, with
your name, github account, and a brief explanation of your suitability.
